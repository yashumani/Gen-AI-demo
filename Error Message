SmartBI Digest & Prompt Engineering Guide
This document guides you through understanding the problem statement behind SmartBI Digest, the solution implemented using Few-Shot Prompting with Google Docs and Gemini, and how mind map networks enhance prompt engineering techniques like Chain of Thoughts and Tree of Thoughts. We will also explore how new prompts utilize these networks to identify correlations and interdependencies with appropriate business logic.
Problem Statement 
Business reporting is often manual, time-consuming, particularly when analyzing complex datasets. Analysts spend significant time:

Interpreting tabular data from multiple sources.
Writing detailed, insightful narratives.
Structuring professional-grade reports for executive audiences.

Tracking changes over time and understanding their implications requires substantial effort. The increasing data volume and reporting frequency make it challenging to answer key questions like "What changed?" quickly and consistently.
Solution: SmartBI Digest
To address these challenges, we developed a prompt engineering-based framework using Few-Shot Prompting with Google Docs and Gemini. This solution enables rapid generation of contextual, structured business reports directly from data tables. It reduces the Level of Effort (LoE) in weekly reporting tasks by automating the summarization and formatting of data-driven insights, providing an immediate understanding of key changes and trends.
Key Benefits:
Provides instant answers to "What Changed?"
Eliminates manual narrative writing.
Offers executive-level reporting in minutes.
Frees up analyst time for deeper analysis.

After implementation, Gemini instantly summarizes key changes and takeaways using well-crafted prompts, and pre-formatted commentary and variance tables reduce report preparation time. Analysts can focus on "why it happened" and "what to do about it."
Prompt Engineering Explained 
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text to be interpreted and understood by Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform specific tasks. It involves designing and improving prompts through natural language.
Anatomy of a Prompt:
Instruction: The core directive of the prompt.
Context: Additional information that helps the model understand the broader scenario.
Input Data: Domain-specific information for relevant output.
Output Indicator: Instructions for formatting the output.
Types of Prompts:
Question & Answering
Text Summarization
Information Extraction
Reasoning
Text Classification
Prompt Engineering Techniques:
Zero-Shot Prompting: No training data provided.
Few-Shot Prompting: Providing a few examples to instruct the LLM.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Augmenting prompts with retrieved context.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Breaking down problems into intermediate steps.
Tree-of-Thought: Exploring multiple solutions.
ReAct (Reason + Act): Generating reasoning and task-specific actions.
Mind Map Network and Prompt Engineering
A mind map network helps provide the context needed for Chain of Thoughts and Tree of Thoughts techniques. By connecting various documents and data sources, we create a knowledge graph that the LLM can use to understand relationships and interdependencies.
How Mind Map Network Helps:
Contextual Understanding: Linking different documents (e.g., data dictionary, promotions, news) provides a comprehensive context.
Identifying Correlations: The network helps identify correlations between metrics and external factors.
Supporting Chain of Thoughts: The LLM can follow the links in the network to break down complex problems step-by-step.
Enabling Tree of Thoughts: The network allows the LLM to explore multiple paths and solutions by traversing different branches of the graph.
New Prompt Templates 
New prompt templates are designed to leverage the mind map network. They instruct the LLM to:

Summarize Top Takeaways: Concisely summarize key insights from the document.
Identify Key Changes: Pinpoint significant changes or trends.
Create Visual Representation: Use tables to represent key data points.
Provide Detailed Commentary: Explain the context and significance of each change.
Analyze Business Implications: Analyze the business implications of identified trends (when requested).
Organize and Format: Organize the output into a well-structured document.
Example Prompt:
"You are an expert business analyst and AI assistant specializing in summarizing and extracting key insights from business reports. I will provide you with the text of a '[Document Name]' Your task is to:

Summarize Top 5 Takeaways: Concisely summarize the top takeaways from each section of the document. Use bullet points for clarity.
Identify Key Changes: Pinpoint significant changes or trends compared to previous periods or forecasts. Highlight areas of improvement, decline, or unexpected performance.
Create Visual Representation: Where possible and relevant, create simple tables to visually represent key data points and changes (e.g., changes in new accounts, net adds, disconnects).
Provide Detailed Commentary: For each major takeaway or change, provide a brief commentary explaining the context and significance.
Analyze Business Implications: Analyze the business implications of the identified trends. What actions or strategies might be needed in response to these insights?
Organize and Format: Organize the output into a well-structured document with clear section headings, bullet points, tables, and concise language. Use bold text for emphasis. Format the text for easy readability.

Sample Prompts and Enhancements 
Sample prompts in the Prompt Repository demonstrate how to analyze specific data tables (e.g., Lines Table, Value Segment Tables, Contra Gross Adds Report). These prompts are enhanced by incorporating the mind map network.
Example: Lines Table Analysis
The prompt instructs the LLM to:

Analyze data from the Lines Table, Data Dictionary, Promotions Tracker, Price Plans Tracker, Business Knowledge, and News Headlines Tracker.
Identify top changes and variances.
Investigate root causes using the provided documents.
Establish interdependencies and correlations between metrics and business drivers.
Enhancing Few-Shot Prompts:
Instead of just providing a few examples, we can enhance Few-Shot Prompts by:

Including Mind Map Links: Provide links to relevant documents in the network.
Specifying Relationships: Explicitly state relationships between different data points and documents.
Requesting Chain of Thoughts: Ask the LLM to explain its reasoning step-by-step.
Encouraging Tree of Thoughts: Ask the LLM to explore multiple possible explanations and choose the most likely one.
Example Enhancement:
"Analyze the Lines Table data. Here are a few examples of insights:

Example 1: [Insight with link to supporting promotion].
Example 2: [Insight with link to relevant news article].

Now, analyze the current data and use the links to the Data Dictionary, Promotions Tracker, and News Headlines Tracker to explain the variances. Provide a Chain of Thoughts for each insight and explore multiple possible explanations using Tree of Thoughts."
New Prompts Using Network for Correlation and Interdependencies
New prompts utilize the network built with various documents to identify correlation and interdependencies with appropriate business logic. The LLM is instructed to:

Refer to multiple sources (Data Dictionary, Promotions, News, etc.).
Identify relationships between metrics and external factors.
Provide explicit calculations and mathematical analysis.
Use terms like "favorable/unfavorable" and "better/worse" for comparisons.
Clearly articulate variances against forecast or prior year benchmarks.

This approach ensures that the generated reports are not just summaries but also provide deep insights and contextual understanding.

By leveraging the mind map network and advanced prompt engineering techniques, SmartBI Digest significantly reduces the effort required for business reporting and empowers analysts to focus on strategic decision-making and impactful storytelling.
