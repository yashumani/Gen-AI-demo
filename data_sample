Light Reading by Kelsey Ziser, March 19, 2025


In this Light Reading podcast, Verizon’s CTO and SVP Yago Tenorio discussed how the service provider 
supports customers’ AI deployments while leveraging AI within its own network. Additionally, Tenorio 
highlighted Verizon’s involvement in Aduna, an API initiative where major carriers are developing 
standardized network APIs.


“The potential to offer functionality through APIs to adjacent industries could open new revenue 
opportunities,” said Tenorio. “[Aduna] aggregates the different APIs from the different operators 
and exposes a single connector to the industry.”

----------------------------------- Verizon boss encourages his teen sons to call instead of text 
and that's the reason he's doing it
PhoneArena by Sebastian Pier, March 18, 2025


Verizon Consumer Group CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath sees no conflict in leading a digital communication 
company while advocating digital boundaries. In a recent opinion piece, Sampath noted he values 
smartphones tremendously but advocates balanced usage, encouraging phone-free meals and outdoor or 
offline activities.


Rather than enforcing arbitrary restrictions, Sampath prefers to guide his sons toward 
self-regulation. “I think smartphones are one of the most important human inventions of the last 
1,000 years,” said Sampath. “They’re beneficial for knowledge, connection, safety, and fun.”

“We’re working with many healthcare organizations, either building new hospitals or restructuring 
the existing hospitals, and they see the wireless as a future for efficiency,” said Peselli. “And 
it’s a lot about efficiency. Believe it or not, one of the biggest problems within hospitals is 
communication.”

I’m the CEO of Verizon’s Consumer Group and the father of 2 sons. I avoid using my phone around my 
teens and encourage them to call over text
Business Insider by Kelly Burch, March 11, 2025


In a conversation with Business Insider, Sowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO of Verizon Consumer Group, 
shares his approach to digital wellness, and what this looks like for his family, including his two 
teenage sons. Sampath wants phones to enhance their lives, not detract from them.


“My wife and I use the Verizon Family app to monitor our kids’ phone use,” said Sampath. “It helps 
us teach them responsible use: If I tell my sons to put down their phones, they might not listen, 
but if I show them they’ve already spent three hours on it, they’re more likely to join me for a 
swim or a basketball game.”

Fierce Network by Dan Jones, March 11, 2025


Despite the hype around AI RAN at MWC25, Verizon CTO and SVP Santiago “Yago” Tenorio thinks that the 
Nvidia and Nokia-backed push to use GPUs to run 5G radio workloads and more on servers in the field 
won’t take off, at least not yet.


Tenorio told Fierce that GPUs don’t offer a performance boost over vRAN and other standard kit in 
the field today and are expensive to use. “If you divide performance by cost, then one day it makes 
sense. Today? No, it doesn’t,” Tenorio said. “Just thinking we’re going to deploy GPUs everywhere is 
a simplification.”

Bloomberg by Molly Schuetz, March 11, 2025


Shares of Verizon dropped sharply on Tuesday after the carrier gave a muted outlook for growth in 
mobile-phone subscribers in the current quarter. Competition among the Big Three is intense as 
Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile all seek to woo customers with more perks and lower prices.


“We’ve seen an elevated level of competitive intensity in the quarter,” said Verizon Chief Revenue 
Officer Frank Boulben on Tuesday. He noted that after the Christmas holiday, when Verizon ended its 
seasonal promotions, its peers did not. “So it’s been a challenging quarter from a competitive 
intensity standpoint.”

Why the CEO of Verizon is telling families to put down their phones
SheKnows by Rita Templeton, March 10, 2025


At Verizon’s Digital Wellness Summit, the carrier unveiled new initiatives to promote healthier 
digital habits, including a Digital Citizenship Initiative and research with Sesame Workshop on 
kids’ tech use. Verizon will also offer free workshops to help families navigate online safety.


“Young kids are on the phone 4 to 5 hours a day, on social every day, get 275 notifications every 
day,” said Verizon Consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath. “So having a healthy digital relationship is 
super important. We have to set boundaries. Those boundaries are going to differ by family, and by 
circumstance. People are going to have to figure that out – our role in the ecosystem will provide 
you with the tools to do that.”

IT management company ServiceNow is launching AI agents geared specifically toward CSPs. Telcos can 
use AI agents to identify and resolve service disruptions in the network as well as help customers 
resolve billing issues. Verizon Business is one of the big-name operators already using ServiceNow’s 
tech.


Shamik Basu, VP of Strategic Connectivity at Verizon Business, said enterprises are using ServiceNow 
to gain better visibility into their network assets – and integrate those insights into their 
existing tools. For Verizon’s part, ServiceNow “kind of powers our tooling to be able to do managed 
services much better,” as it allows the carrier to integrate natively onto a customer’s platform.

Researchers at MIT calculate that as global warming continues, it may reduce the available space for 
satellites in low Earth orbit by anywhere from one-third to 82% by the end of the century. That’s 
because space will become more littered with debris as climate change lessens nature’s way of 
cleaning it up.

Excessive phone and screen use tied to manic symptoms for one group, study finds
Fox News by Angelica Stabile, March 8, 2025


A recent study from the University of California found that pre-teens with greater exposure to 
certain types of tech use could be at a higher risk of developing manic symptoms. This comes on the 
heels of Verizon’s 2024 Consumer Connections Report, which revealed that kids use social media for 
four to five hours a day and receive between 250 and 275 notifications daily.


Verizon hosted its first-ever “digital wellness summit” in NYC last week to share insights about the 
safe use of technology. Sowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO of Verizon Consumer Group, discussed the

----------------------------------- Why some shared responsibility models fail and how to help 
better protect your data
Forbes by Chris Novak, March 7, 2025


Chris Novak, Managing Director of Cyber Security Consulting at Verizon, writes that today’s 
interconnected data ecosystem extends beyond third-party vendors to an “nth-party” reality with data 
flowing through multiple organizational layers.


This complexity necessitates clearly defined responsibilities between organizations and their 
partners, notes Novak. Shared responsibility contracts help establish this clarity, delineating data 
ownership and protection roles while reducing ambiguity that could hide potential risks.

started doing really well. [Suddenly then the attitude was], ‘We need more stores’.”

PhoneArena by Sebastian Pier, March 6, 2025


At a recent Morgan Stanley conference, Verizon CFO Tony Skiadas noted the average upgrade cycle now 
extends beyond 42 months. He argued customers are choosing to keep their devices longer due to 
improvements in smartphone durability and performance.


Skiadas said while there was a slight increase in upgrades in Q4 of 2024, Verizon expects only 
mid-single-digit growth in upgrade volumes for 2025. Despite this trend, the carrier remains focused 
on customer retention and maintaining a disciplined approach to its offerings.

Verizon says
Fierce Network by Mitch Wagner, March 6, 2025


At an industry analyst roundtable this week, Verizon executives highlighted AI’s role in driving 
enterprise bandwidth demand, emphasizing their AI Connect strategy leveraging fiber assets across 71 
US cities and partnerships with GPU-as-a-Service providers to meet distributed computing needs.



“Many of these providers are infrastructure-disadvantaged because they haven’t had time to build up 
their fiber networks,” said Scott Lawrence, SVP and Chief Product Officer at Verizon Business. The

for enterprises offering services to consumers,” said Peselli. “Private 5G allows you to control 
security and performance. In the past 24 months we’ve seen big interest from three industries: 
healthcare, retail and logistics distribution.”

How AI tools are reshaping the coding workforce
The Wall Street Journal by Isabelle Bousquette, March 4, 2025


AI coding tools are transforming software development and boosting efficiency while reshaping 
workforce needs, with companies reporting leaner teams and a shift in developer priorities toward AI 
prompting. But CIOs say the gap between what they can do today and their future potential is big.


Verizon’s Chief Data and AI Officer Kalyani Sekar said the tools were enabling the team to clear a 
backlog of business requests more quickly, but not to the extent that she’s considering staffing 
changes. “Maybe when the backlog is going to a very nominal level. And at that time, we really need 
to think about it,” said Sekar. “I won’t claim victory at this point in time.”

Verizon Consumer CEO on AI’s role in telecom
Bloomberg Tech Disruptors by Mandeep Singh and John Butler, February 28, 2025


In this episode of the Tech Disruptors podcast, CEO of Verizon’s Consumer Group, Sowmyanarayan 
Sampath, discusses the company’s AI deployment and future plans. Sampath highlights AI’s role in 
customer service and its potential expansion into network operations, software development and RAN.


“We have one of the world’s largest contact centers. We take north of 200 million incoming calls 
every single year and that puts us in a pretty unique position to deploy AI at scale,” Sampath said. 
“We have deployed AI to more than 30,000 of our frontline call center agents in little less than a 
year’s time.”

India’s increased budgetary allocation for cybersecurity meaningful: Verizon Business
ET Telecom by Muntazir Abbas, February 27, 2025


Robert Le Busque, Regional Vice President of Asia Pacific at Verizon Business, spoke to ET Telecom 
about the company’s enterprise portfolio, HCL partnership, India’s increased budgetary spend on 
cybersecurity, and private 5G network.


Verizon is seeing more advanced ransomware attacks in the APAC region, said Le Buque, noting that 
network and digital transformation is a key driver of the company’s business. Cloud adoption, 
distributed architecture, and GenAI are “driving enterprise technology”, meaning “enterprises need 
to think very differently about their network and service architecture”.

Verizon has developed its own virtual cloud platform, focusing on building internal expertise in

in virtualized and cloud RAN in the core, then we better have an organization that’s best at that,

Starlink owner Musk wrongly accuses Verizon of faulty US aviation system
Reuters by David Shepardson and Mrinmay Dey, February 27, 2025


Elon Musk on Thursday falsely accused Verizon, a rival contractor of his SpaceX Starlink system, of 
putting US air safety at risk through a communications system that’s actually operated by L3Harris. 
Musk later admitted he made a mistake when he said Verizon operated the system, and posted a 
correction on X.


Verizon rejected Musk’s initial accusation, saying it has only just begun work on the system. “We 
are at the beginning of a multi-year contract to replace antiquated, legacy systems. Our teams have 
been working with the FAA’s technology teams and our solution stands ready to be deployed,” Verizon 
said.

Verizon jumps on satellite video call with AST SpaceMobile
The Fast Mode by Andrea Yukta L., February 25, 2025


Verizon and AST have successfully trialed a live video call between two mobile devices with one 
connected via satellite and the other connected via Verizon’s terrestrial network connection. To 
complement Verizon’s network coverage, the companies are building the fastest satellite to device 
network with text, voice and live video calling capability.


“Adding this layer of ability – not only to text someone, but to be able to call, video chat, or 
send files – whether in the wilderness, or in a remote part of a lake community, will only enhance 
the reliability of our customers’ connectivity and communication experience,” said Hans Vestberg, 
Verizon’s Chairman and CEO.

In this article for Fast Company, Verizon Consumer Group CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath shares the 
findings of Verizon’s most recent Consumer Connections Report, which explores the interplay between 
digital and physical shopping experiences, and the growing reliance on home connectivity.


The report also looks at how NFL fans showed up for their favorite teams, alongside the events and 
moments from the past year that connected us most as a society. Sampath writes that mobile devices 
connect us all to a world of opportunity, but don’t replace the world. Recognizing that truth is one

FAA testing Musk’s Starlink at 3 sites to fix ‘reliability’ issue
The Hill by Ashleigh Fields, February 25, 2025


The FAA has begun testing Starlink’s internet platform to address long-standing connectivity 
problems in remote US airspace. Initial tests include terminals in Atlantic City and Alaska. 
Starlink owner Elon Musk claimed Verizon’s current system poses safety risks to travelers. Verizon 
is not expecting the Starlink testing to impact its 15-year contract with the FAA.


“Verizon is bringing the nation’s most reliable network to the FAA at a time when critical 
infrastructure and technology enhancements are needed most,” a Verizon spokesperson said. 
“Protecting Americans who rely on a safe, secure and functioning air traffic control system is more 
important than ever, and our enhancements will help make that happen.”

The American Birkebeiner ski race last week resumed on its original Cable to Hayward course after

internet and cell connections in remote areas to “enable them to be able to talk via cellular or 
through any other devices that they have”.

How to bolster loyalty marketing
ANA by Chuck Kapelke, February 21, 2025


Loyalty programs strengthen relationships with customers and drive sustained purchases, with big 
brands like Verizon finding new ways to keep their programs fresh. Verizon recently streamlined 
their Verizon Access program, adding exclusive experiences like NFL meetups and private concerts.


“We focused on loyalty being additive and providing access to experiences that you may not be able 
to get from other providers, or even other loyalty programs,” said Nick Kelly, Head of Partnerships 
at Verizon. “We’re not just competing directly with our category. We’re competing with American 
Express and Delta and everybody else. For us, it became, ‘How do we stand out?’”

Verizon’s Consumer Connections Report with Consumer Group CEO Sampath
The Week with Roger by Roger Entner, February 10, 2025


Verizon Consumer Group CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath joined analysts Don Kellogg and Roger Entner on The 
Week with Roger podcast to discuss Verizon’s newly-released Consumer Connections Report and the 
various insights it provides.


“We’re America’s largest network, which puts us in the unique position to understand trends in 
society and how people interact with technology,” said Sampath. “We use these insights to make our 
products better.” A big takeaway from this year’s report is that parents are concerned about how

How Verizon took its local marketing strategy to the Super Bowl
Ad Age by Brandon Doerrer, February 12, 2025


Verizon shifted its Super Bowl marketing strategy in 2025, foregoing a national TV ad in favor of 
hosting 30 local watch parties across NFL markets. The FanFest events featured city-specific 
entertainment, food, and memorabilia, drawing more than 40,000 attendees.


“We felt so strongly about the FanFest idea and concept that we felt it would break through,” said 
Nick Kelly, VP of Partnerships at Verizon. “We didn’t need to also have a TV commercial out there 
promoting it. We’re fully bought into the idea of showing up locally.”

Verizon increases 5G coverage as Super Bowl approaches
Fox News by Staff Writer, February 8, 2025


Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg joined “Fox & Friends Weekend” ahead of the Super Bowl to discuss why the 
NFL is such an important partner for Verizon, the 5G mobile technology that connects fans to the Big 
Game, and Verizon’s FanFest experience at NFL stadiums around the country.


“Sport and live entertainment are really what brings communities together, and of course, the NFL is 
the biggest sport in the US, that’s why we’ve been invested in the NFL for many, many years,” said 
Vestberg. Not only is Verizon a sponsor, the carrier also builds the technology that supports the 
NFL. “So for us this is both business and a way to get something to our customers.”

Joe Russo, EVP and President of Global Networks and Technology at Verizon, was onsite at Super Bowl

Russo spoke to SVG about Verizon’s efforts and the future of 5G as a tool for broadcast production.


With fans increasingly live streaming stadium events, uplink has become a focus area in recent

that more and more robust because more and more people will be streaming these events,” Russo said.

Verizon installed about 509 5G UltraWideband and 155 C-band radios inside Caesars Superdome in

WWD by Arthur Zaczkiewicz, February 6, 2025


Verizon’s 2024 Consumer Connections Report takes a close look at its products and services and how 
they impact consumers and families. Exploring digital-physical shopping trends, the rise in social 
media and smart device usage, and tech’s role in enhancing familial relationships, Verizon’s latest 
insights underscore the evolving landscape of consumer connections.


Looking at shopping trends, Verizon said today’s customer experience “happens wherever the customer 
wants – online, in person, on the phone or all of the above”. Overall, Verizon found that 23% of 
customer purchases were done online in 2024, and most customers “who used in-store pickup initiated 
their order online”.

Light Reading by Kelsey Ziser, February 6, 2025


Verizon carefully hid its network equipment throughout the Superdome, balancing the need to provide 
comprehensive wireless coverage for Super Bowl fans while maintaining the venue’s visual appeal. 
Light Reading toured the stadium ahead to get a detailed breakdown of Verizon’s network upgrade.


It was a “complete rip and replace of the old system in the stadium”, said Gerard Hudson, Principal 
Network Performance Engineer at Verizon. The upgrade also included a 750-watt backup generator, and 
added more 4G LTE, 5G, mmWave and C-band spectrum to the Superdome network, Hudson added.

Space by Robert Z. Pearlman, February 2, 2025


Verizon teamed up with Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and iconic “Can you hear me now?” Test Man 
Paul Marcarelli to promote its satellite-powered solution for cell service dead zones. In a new ad, 
Aldrin demonstrates Verizon’s expanded satellite connectivity, allowing select phones to send texts 
in remote areas.


“It’s been 10 years since I last asked America ‘Can you hear me now?’” said Marcarelli. “Back then 
dead zones were everywhere and it’s safe to say today they’re only in the most remote places, like

‘Can you hear me now?’ character returns in new Verizon commercial with Buzz Aldrin
USA Today by Mike Snider, January 31, 2025



Verizon’s iconic “Test Man” character has teamed up with Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin to test 
satellite connectivity in space. In a new commercial, which aired during Sunday’s Grammy Awards, 
Verizon revived the catchphrase, “Can you hear me now?”.


The ad highlights Verizon’s current use of satellite “so customers can stay connected”, said Joe 
Russo, Verizon’s EVP and President of Global Networks and Technology. Aldrin is a “legend” and 
“icon”, said Leslie Berland, EVP and CMO for Verizon, and he was the “dream person” to be part of 
the commercial “to bring this story and this technology to life”.

Verizon has tripled network capacity in New Orleans ahead of Super Bowl LIX, installing 560 miles of

Verizon reported strong broadband growth in Q4 2024, adding 408,000 net subscribers across its Fios 
fiber and FWA services. The company aims to reach nearly 700,000 Fios customers this year, with

fiber. Verizon Consumer Group CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath added that ARPU is increasing as more 
consumers take higher-level product packages.

Fierce Network by Monica Alleven, January 23, 2025


In a wide-ranging discussion with Fierce Network, Verizon CTO Santiago “Yago” Tenorio talked about 
open RAN’s challenges, vendor diversity, and his transition from Vodafone to Verizon’s innovative 
technology landscape.


RAN is usually the biggest line item in a mobile operator’s budget, and having supply chain 
“optionality” is a good thing, Tenorio said. “You can debate what is the right number [of vendors], 
but certainly it is not two. You need four or five. That would be a more competitive landscape.”

‘Once in a Lifetime’: Inside Verizon’s historically ambitious Super Bowl FanFest
Little Black Book by Adam Bennett, January 22, 2025


Nick Kelly, Verizon’s VP of Partnerships, spoke with Little Black Book ahead of next month’s Verizon 
Super Bowl FanFest. Verizon will host simultaneous Super Bowl experiences across 30 NFL markets, 
offering fans locally-flavored celebrations.


“The Super Bowl is practically a national holiday, but very few people actually get to experience it 
live in the stadium,” said Kelly. “So, we decided to do something that has never been done before 
and bring all the magic of the Super Bowl to fans across the country, putting customers and fans at 
the heart of the biggest simultaneous party ever.”

----------------------------------- Verizon (fortunately) left THOR out of LA fire response
Fierce Network by Monica Alleven, January 21, 2025


Verizon often deploys THOR when reacting to natural disasters, but in the case of the LA wildfires, 
the operator decided to leave its mobile rapid response command center vehicle behind given that 
fire trucks had trouble getting around after people fled.


“Everybody’s coming in with big assets, so our goal is to reduce that footprint and cause less 
disruption in the response as we can,” said Cory Davis, VP at Verizon Frontline. “THOR’s not needed 
because the assets we have in place are doing a fantastic job.”

Digiday Podcast by Kimeko McCoy, January 21, 2025


Nick Kelly, Verizon’s VP of Partnerships, joined the Digiday Podcast to discuss the carrier’s 
revamped sports marketing strategy, venturing into NIL (name, image and likeness) deals and this 
year’s Super Bowl plans.


In contrast with other brands sponsoring women’s leagues and teams, Verizon hopes to strike NIL 
ideals that are “authentic and can make a difference”, Kelly said. “We want to tell stories and 
empower athletes to go out there and do whatever it is that they’re passionate about.”

With full speed ahead on AI investment, does ROI matter?

In this article for Fast Company, Verizon Consumer Group CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath explores the ROI 
considerations of AI investment across business sectors. He breaks down the projected $1 trillion AI 
spending wave, analyzing how companies must generate economic value to justify investments.


Sampath categorizes companies into three groups: Big Tech companies making necessary large-scale 
investments despite uncertain returns; supply chain companies that must overinvest in capacity; and 
applied AI users like Verizon taking a measured, ROI-focused approach.

Future Back Drinking: Sowmyanarayan Sampath
TIME by Dr. Athina Kanioura, January 15, 2025


In this episode of PepsiCo and TIME’s Future Back Drinking podcast, Dr. Athina Kanioura spoke to 
Sowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO of Verizon Consumer Group. From the future of AI to the next big 
breakthroughs in consumer connectivity, Sampath dived into the trends shaping tomorrow.


“Today you can leave your home without your wallet and your car keys, but you can’t leave without a 
phone,” said Sampath. “Phones are an important part of people’s lives and we empower people to live 
their best life every single day. So we think a better network is always a good option. Over the 
past seven or eight years, Verizon has invested $200 billion in its network.”

How wireless companies keep signals alive in wildfires
KTLA by Rich DeMuro, January 15, 2025


As power outages threaten communications during the Los Angeles wildfires, Verizon is spearheading 
the telecom industry’s response with robust mobile solutions. “I think we have five macros out of 
service, comparatively speaking, when the first fire broke out it was 140,” said Verizon’s Pacific 
Market President, Steven Keller.


The company has more than 550 mobile assets ready to deploy, including drones, helping overcome 
power disruptions. “It’s a temporary deployed asset to ensure we have our best and most capable 
wireless service and technology available on the spot,” added Keller.

*Fierce Network* by Dan Jones, November 27, 2024


Verizon technicians spoke to Fierce Network about their efforts to upgrade
multiple 5G sites and deploy 20 fiber circuits ahead of the Macy’s
Thanksgiving Day parade. It took them about two weeks to support NBC’s
broadcast and public streaming of the event.


Verizon tech Enzo Amati was on hand at 4am on the day of the parade to
switch on their router to allow Macy’s to start ticketing people. The
parade didn’t require as many fiber circuits as the New York Marathon,
Amati said. Verizon installed 30 circuits for that this year.

Verizon Boosts Its Starting Wage to $20 an Hour in Tight Job Market
Bloomberg by Scott Moritz, April 18, 2022


Verizon Communications Inc. is the latest wireless carrier to raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, 
reflecting the tighter job market and a push by labor organizers to unionize retail and customer 
service employees.


New staffers answering customer calls and working in stores at Verizon will start at that rate, and 
existing employees who make less will get raises, according to a release Monday.


“These changes are the direct result of employee feedback and will help us remain an attractive 
employer in this competitive environment,” Krista Bourne, chief operating officer for Verizon 
Consumer Group, said in the release.

deal
RCR Wireless by Sean Kinney, April 18, 2022


Verizon has taken a keen interest in vendor Casa Systems. In addition to striking a multi-year deal 
to supply 5G core network functions, Verizon is also investing approximately $40 million into the 
U.S.-based firm which equates to just under a 10% ownership stake.


According to a statement from Casa Systems, the company will provide Verizon with 5G core functions 
to embolden its public mobile edge computing offering. For its public MEC play, Verizon has 
partnered with AWS to offer edge compute services in 13 of the top 20 U.S. metropolitan markets.


Verizon’s Kyle Malady, president of global networks and technology, said in a statement, “Casa 
Systems is an important member of our 5G and MEC ecosystem, providing flexible applications that 
will allow us to scale up for our customers as real-time solutions continue to grow. We have 
confidence in Casa as a cloud-native technology partner and look forward to joint innovation as we 
scale the power of 5G and MEC in the years to come.”

still waiting
XDA Developers by Corbin Davenport, April 18, 2022


The LG Velvet was the last mainstream flagship phone from LG before the company gave up on 
smartphones, excluding the swiveling LG Wing. The company promised to keep its existing phones 
updated for a little while longer, and now the first U.S. carrier version of the Velvet is receiving 
its Android 12 upgrade.


Verizon is now rolling out Android 12 to its carrier variant of the LG Velvet, known officially as 
the LG Velvet 5G UW. The update has a software version of G900VM30a, and the February 2022 security 
patch level — yes, it’s almost May, but LG wasn’t great at quick updates even when it was selling 
phones. Below is the full changelog.

Mashable by Alex Perry, April 18, 2022


Last time we caught up with Speedtest’s ranking of all three major 5G networks in the U.S., 
T-Mobile’s lead was so massive that it didn’t seem fair. Three months later, and that’s changed…a 
bit.


The latest quarterly network speed report from Speedtest dropped Monday. For the most part, it 
confirmed what we already knew: T-Mobile still has the fastest and most widely available 5G network 
in the country. But this time, at least in terms of median download speed, the gap between first and 
second place has shrunk

T-Mobile getting revenge on hackers
Light Reading by Mike Dano, April 18, 2022


It appears that justice may be coming to some of the hackers involved in the theft of data from 
T-Mobile last year, according to newly released government documents.


The documents also help shine a light on T-Mobile's unsuccessful efforts to halt the spread of the 
personal information of millions of its current and prospective customers.



Finally, the developments also arrive during a dramatic upswing in mobile spam, a situation that 
isn't necessarily tied to the hack of T-Mobile or other companies but is nonetheless an indication 
of the increasingly tumultuous security landscape for regular mobile customers as well as big 
telecommunications corporations.

----------------------------------- T-Mobile's New Base Essentials Unlimited Plan Targets Those With 
1 or 2 Lines
CNET by Eli Blumenthal, April 18, 2022


T-Mobile has a new unlimited plan coming this week that is cheaper than its other offerings. Just be 
prepared to give up some perks.


The new plan, called Base Essentials, launches on April 21 and runs $45 per month for a single line 
or a $15 savings compared with its current cheapest Essentials unlimited plan, which is $60 per 
month. The new option is also $25 cheaper than the Magenta option and $40 less than a single line on 
its priciest Magenta Max offering.


With this plan, you'll get 20GB of high-speed data and access to T-Mobile's 5G network, but you will 
lose out on high-speed data after that allotment has been used up. Instead, your download speeds 
will slow to 1.5Mbps for the remainder of your billing cycle.

----------------------------------- AT&T tests antennas using a drone
RCR Wireless by Kelly Hill, April 18, 2022


AT&T is using a drone carrying a lightweight signal generator to test high-gain outdoor antennas in 
spectrum up to 40 GHz.


As described in AT&T’s filings with the Federal Communications Commission, the carrier seeks to 
measure the radiated patterns of high-gain antennas in order to qualify them for point-to-point 
links and to test sidelobe suppression techniques.


“Correctly measuring the radiation pattern of a high-gain antenna can be challenging as it must be 
done in the antenna’s far field, often at 100 meters or more,” AT&T said in its filing, adding that



traditional outdoor testing can run into issues such as ground and structural reflections, while 
tower-based experiments add logistics and personnel safety issues. AT&T said that it wanted to use a 
drone because it would be a “faster, easier and safer way to make such measurements.”

----------------------------------- Comcast, Charter to rake in 16.5M mobile lines by 2025 – 
forecast
Light Reading by Jeff Baumgartner, April 18, 2022


A revised forecast from research firm MoffettNathanson paints an even rosier picture for the 
still-budding mobile businesses of Comcast and Charter Communications.


Reflecting an updated understanding of the benefits Comcast and Charter enjoy because of Wi-Fi data 
offloading, MoffettNathanson's new financial analysis and forecast expects the cable operators to 
generate more mobile subscribers, higher mobile revenues and EBIDTA, and improved ARPU by the end of 
2025 when compared to a forecast issued in June 2021.


Based on the new forecast, MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett expects Comcast to end 2025 with 
9.05 million mobile lines, ahead of an earlier forecast of 7.04 million. Charter, meanwhile, is 
expected to have 7.47 million mobile lines by the end of 2025, up from an earlier prediction of 6.54 
million. Combined, the companies are expected to have 16.5 million mobile lines by the end of 2025.

The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is the overall fastest 5G phone in the US and Canada, beating the Apple

This agrees with our initial test results of the Galaxy S22 series, where we found that the S22

I tested AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile’s 5G with 70,000 people
Digital Trends by Adam Doud, April 15, 2022


Last week, when the fine folks at AT&T invited me to come down to New Orleans and check out one of 
their disaster recovery sites, they also included a little perk: The chance to attend the NCAA Men’s 
College Basketball Championship game.


5G carries a lot of promises, which include increased speed and lower latency. That’s great, but the 
third pillar of 5G greatness — bandwidth — has never manifested itself for me.


So, when AT&T told me I’d be sitting in a room with 70,000 of my closest friends, I eagerly jumped 
at the chance to see where things stand in 2022. In my suitcase to New Orleans, I packed three 
Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultras, one each for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Two of the S22 Ultras were 
unlocked review samples provided by Samsung and AT&T respectively. The third was my personal 
T-Mobile branded S22 Ultra that I purchased on launch day.


During the game, I took all three phones and roamed the arena, from the seats on the floor (thank 
you AT&T) all the way to the nose-bleeds in section 645. I circled the entire arena during the 
process and covered about as much ground as one fat guy with a bad knee can cover in the space of a 
40-minute game.

----------------------------------- The new iPhone SE 2022 is now buy-one get-one free at Verizon 
for a limited time
TechRadar by Alex Whitelock, April 17, 2022


If you've been patiently waiting for new iPhone SE 2022 deals to drop at Verizon, then your wait is 
over - you can now score yourself a device on the house with the carrier's latest promo.


Specifically, you'll get an additional device for free when you purchase the first outright with a 
new line on an unlimited plan. Up until this point, promotions on this new budget Apple device have 
been curiously missing from the carrier's site - especially trade-ins and multi-line savings like 
this one.
