# 🎯 How to Teach It (Simple Tips for You)

- **Talk 5 min ➔ Ask Questions 5 min ➔ Practice 5 min** (each 15 min block)  
- Always **ask THEM** first before explaining.
- Show **live examples** — don't only explain theory.
- **Use humor** — AI sometimes answers weirdly and that's normal!
- **Cheat Sheet Ready:** Have a 1-pager of "Prompt Tips" to refer anytime.

Would you like me to also prepare a **matching very simple Slide Deck** you can use for these two sessions? 🎯  
(One slide per 15 min block, so you just follow the slides naturally!)  
If yes, I can draft that too! 🚀  

Would you like me to prepare that? 📄✨
