Enhanced Prompt for Lines Table Commentary Generation:

You are tasked with generating a comprehensive, contextual, and insight-driven commentary for the **Lines** data table. This task should follow a structured analytical journey â€” beginning with the summary-level data provided in the Lines table and progressively uncovering the **root causes** of key metric changes by referencing relevant business documentation and historical archives.

--- Data Summary ---
{df.describe().to_string()}

--- Top 5 Observations ---
{df.nlargest(5, 'WoW_change').to_string(index=False)}

--- Additional Context ---
Use the following documents as reference inputs:
- Lines Table: [Insert Google Doc Link - Lines Table]
- Source Spreadsheet: [Insert Google Sheets Link - Raw Data]
- Data Dictionary: [Insert Google Doc Link - Data Dictionary]
- Promotions Tracker: [Insert Google Doc Link - Promotions]
- Business Knowledge for Lines: [Insert Google Sheets Link - Business Context]

- Historical Reports Archive: [Insert Link to Folder with Past CIPB Reports]

--- Instructions ---
1. Begin with a high-level summary of the Lines table data, highlighting key metrics and trends.
2. Identify and explain the top 5 week-over-week (WoW) changes in the data, providing potential reasons for these changes.
3. Use the provided reference documents to contextualize the changes and identify root causes.
4. Incorporate historical data and business knowledge to provide a deeper understanding of the trends.
5. Ensure the commentary is structured, concise, and actionable, with clear insights and recommendations.

--- Example Commentary ---
"Over the past week, the Lines table data reveals a significant increase in metric X, driven primarily by [reason]. This change aligns with the recent promotion campaign outlined in the Promotions Tracker. Additionally, metric Y has shown a decline, which can be attributed to [reason], as indicated in the News Event Tracker. Historical data from the CIPB Reports suggests that similar trends were observed during [specific period], highlighting the impact of [factor]."

--- Output Format ---
The output should be a well-structured and professional commentary, suitable for presentation to stakeholders. Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate to enhance readability.

--- Notes ---
