Step 3: Inputting the Prompt into Gemini
Replace the [Google Document Link], [Lines Table Google Doc Link], [Data Dictionary Google Doc Link], and [Value Segment Table Google Doc Link] in the prompts with the actual document links that include the data tables for input and [Document Name] with the new document name.
Input the chosen prompt into Gemini. You can do this in two ways:
Document Creation: If Gemini is integrated into your Google Docs, paste the prompt directly into the document creation window.

Setting Up Document Creation
Open your web browser and navigate to Google Docs. You can do this by going to docs.google.com.
If you are not already logged in, sign in with your Google account.
To create a new document, click on the “File” button → “New” → “Document”

Click on “Create a document” button that appears on the blank document
			

Via the Chatbot Interface: Open Gemini and start a new conversation. Paste the prompt into the chat window.


Step 4: Executing the Analysis
Initiate the Analysis:
Document Creation: If using the document creation window, look for a button like "Generate" or "Run" to start the analysis.
Chatbot Interface: Press Enter or click on the "Send" button to submit the prompt to Gemini.
Processing Time: Gemini will take a few moments to process your prompt and analyze the data. The processing time may vary depending on the complexity of the prompt and the size of the data table.

Step 5: Reviewing and Refining the Output
Review the Results: Once Gemini has finished processing, carefully review the generated output. Check for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
Refine the Prompts: If the output is not satisfactory, refine your prompts and re-run the analysis. You may need to experiment with different phrasings or specify additional details to guide Gemini toward the desired insights.
Iterate: Continue refining your prompts and re-running the analysis until you achieve the desired level of detail and insight. You may also provide additional guidance to Gemini on the specific vocabulary or terminology to include in the output. For example, if you're analyzing customer feedback, you might ask Gemini to focus on specific terms like "price," "quality," or "customer service." Or, if you're working on a medical research project, you might provide Gemini with a list of relevant medical terms.

Step 6: Incorporating the Output into Your Report
Copy and Paste: Copy the relevant sections of the Gemini output and paste them into your Google Doc report.
Formatting: Adjust the formatting of the pasted content to match the style of your report.
Add Context: Provide additional context or commentary as needed to integrate the Gemini insights seamlessly into your report narrative.
Visualizations: If Gemini has generated tables or charts, consider incorporating them into your report for enhanced visual appeal and clarity.

Conclusion

Through crafting detailed prompts and an iterative refinement process, users can harness the power of Google Docs and Gemini to generate advanced, data-driven reports. This synergy allows for the extraction of valuable insights from data, presented in a clear, concise, and impactful manner, ultimately enhancing business decision-making and reporting efficiency.
