## üóÇÔ∏è **Phase 1 Task Breakdown**

### **Task 1.1: Define Target Commentary Style & Criteria**

- **Purpose:** Clearly outline expectations of Gemini-generated commentary.
  
**Action Items:**
- Clearly document requirements:
  - **Length**: Specify target word count (e.g., ‚â§100 words per summary).
  - **Tone**: Professional, concise, insightful, executive-friendly.
  - **Content Expectations**:
    - Key metrics (revenue, growth %, margins).
    - Notable trends, drivers, challenges.
    - Clear language and terminology aligned with Verizon BI standards.

**Deliverable:**
- A concise requirement/specification document.

---

### **Task 1.2: Prepare Structured Sample Data**

- **Purpose:** Provide realistic representative data samples for accurate testing of Gemini prompt effectiveness.

**Action Items:**
- Extract representative table data manually from Google Sheets and Docs.
- Convert data samples into standardized structured JSON or DataFrames clearly labeled with dimensions, metrics, and periods.

**Example Structured Data:**
```json
{
  "Section": "Revenue Analysis",
  "Period": "March 2025",
  "Metrics": {
    "Revenue": 2500000,
    "Growth %": 7.5,
    "Margin %": 28.0
  },
  "Top Drivers": ["Wireless", "Broadband"],
  "Challenges": ["Churn Rate: 2.8%", "Competitor Pricing"]
}
```

**Deliverable:**
- A repository of structured sample datasets (minimum 3-5 different examples covering varied scenarios).

---

### **Task 1.3: Experiment with Zero-shot and Few-shot Prompting**

- **Purpose:** Test initial prompting strategies to assess immediate accuracy, consistency, and style alignment.

**Action Items:**
- Conduct targeted experiments:
  - **Zero-shot prompting** (Direct instruction-based)
  - **Few-shot prompting** (Providing explicit examples)
- Clearly document the performance of each approach, capturing accuracy, consistency, and clarity.

**Example Prompt (Few-shot approach):**
```markdown
You are an analyst summarizing Verizon‚Äôs business reports.

Example Input:
Section: Revenue Performance  
Period: February 2025  
Metrics: Revenue $2.1M (+4%), Margin 27%  
Drivers: Smartphones, Accessories  
Challenges: Churn rate increased slightly to 3%

Example Commentary:
‚ÄúIn February 2025, revenue grew 4% reaching $2.1M, with a healthy margin of 27%. Growth was primarily driven by Smartphones and Accessories, though the slight increase in churn rate (3%) needs attention.‚Äù

---

Now summarize this data:

Input:
Section: {{Section}}
Period: {{Period}}
Metrics: {{Metrics}}
Drivers: {{Top Drivers}}
Challenges: {{Challenges}}

Brief Commentary:
```

**Deliverable:**
- Test report summarizing comparative results between Zero-shot and Few-shot prompting.

---

### **Task 1.4: Design and Refine Prompt Templates**

- **Purpose:** Develop robust, reusable prompt templates based on successful experiments.

**Action Items:**
- Create standardized template structures.
- Refine through multiple iterations based on Gemini response evaluations.
- Include placeholders for structured data integration.

**Finalized Prompt Template Example:**
```markdown
You are a Verizon Business Intelligence Analyst generating brief executive-level commentary based on structured data inputs.

Data Input:
- Section: {{Section}}
- Reporting Period: {{Period}}
- Metrics: {{Metrics}}
- Top-performing Drivers: {{Top Drivers}}
- Key Challenges: {{Challenges}}

Brief Commentary (under 100 words):
```

**Deliverable:**
- At least two validated, production-ready prompt templates.

---

### **Task 1.5: Evaluate Commentary Quality & Consistency**

- **Purpose:** Validate that Gemini outputs consistently meet the defined commentary criteria.

**Action Items:**
- Generate commentary from structured sample data using finalized prompts.
- Evaluate against defined criteria (accuracy, tone, conciseness, completeness).
- Document results clearly and refine prompts as necessary.

**Quality Evaluation Criteria:**

| Metric              | Criteria                         | Expected Result                         |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**        | Commentary correctly reflects input data. | 95%+ accuracy                           |
| **Conciseness**     | Within defined length constraints | ‚â§ 100 words consistently                |
| **Completeness**    | Covers required metrics, drivers, challenges clearly | 100% required topics coverage           |
| **Tone & Clarity**  | Professional, insightful, clear  | Consistently meets executive standards  |

**Deliverable:**
- Evaluation report detailing prompt performance.
- Documentation of successful Gemini-generated commentary examples.

## ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Milestone & Success Criteria**

**Success Criteria:**  
- Clearly defined target style and criteria.
- Validated structured data samples available.
- Experimentally confirmed best prompting strategy (Few-shot preferred).
- Finalized prompt templates capable of consistent, accurate outputs.
- Gemini-generated commentary consistently achieving set evaluation metrics.

**Final Deliverables:**

|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Ambiguous Gemini responses            | Refine prompts to add clarity, specificity.   |
| Low consistency in outputs            | Switch to Few-shot prompting with clear examples. |
| Length or detail misalignment         | Explicitly define constraints in prompts.     |
| Lack of accuracy in generated summaries | Iteratively test and refine, adding detailed examples. |
