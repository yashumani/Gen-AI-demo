### Candidate Experience / Background

“I’ve been with Verizon since 2021, moving from a Business Data Analyst to a BI Consultant role. Across this journey, I’ve automated finance and operational reporting using Qlik, ThoughtSpot, Looker, and BigQuery. I led initiatives that reduced report generation time by over 40%, integrated Gemini AI for predictive insights, and established BI frameworks across finance teams. Prior to Verizon, I built ETL and ML pipelines in Knime/Alteryx and developed NLP-based projects in grad school. These experiences gave me both technical depth and leadership exposure, preparing me to drive BI transformation as Sr. Manager.”

### Job Knowledge 1 (Example Q: Describe steps involved in automating a reporting solution)

**Situation:** Verizon’s finance teams relied on manual Google Sheets reporting.
**Task:** Automate reporting for real-time KPI visibility.
**Action:** I designed BigQuery datasets, scripted ETL pipelines in Knime/Apps Script, and created standardized Qlik dashboards with safety guardrails.
**Result:** Reduced manual effort by 60%, improved reporting speed, and empowered 200+ finance users with self-service analytics.

### Job Knowledge 2 (Example Q: Trend in 12–24 months impacting BI work)

“I see **AI-powered BI and data democratization** as the biggest trend. Gemini AI, coupled with tools like ThoughtSpot, is transforming how non-technical users interact with data. My current projects already embed Gemini for anomaly detection and commentary generation. I believe enabling finance teams with AI-augmented insights will drive Verizon’s next wave of efficiency.”

### Technical / Functional Capability (Example Q: Using analysis to suggest improvement)

**Situation:** In 2023, I analyzed Verizon’s profitability trends.
**Task:** Identify pricing inefficiencies.
**Action:** Built a BigQuery ML model to forecast revenue impact of different pricing scenarios, visualized in Qlik.
**Result:** Insights helped leadership refine promotions strategy, leading to a 15% uplift in campaign ROI within one quarter.

### Drive for Results (Example Q: Time you discovered a more efficient way to complete a task)

**Situation:** Finance reporting involved manual data pulls.
**Action:** I automated recurring reporting with Looker Studio + BigQuery scripts, integrated workflow triggers, and built monitoring tables.
**Result:** Delivery timelines shortened by 25%, freeing analysts’ time for deeper insights. My proactive push for automation was later scaled across other reporting teams.

---

### Collaboration (Example Q: Gaining buy-in for a new process)

**Situation:** Stakeholders were hesitant to move from Tableau to ThoughtSpot.
**Action:** I ran shadow sessions showing reduced run times (40 mins → 15 mins) and trained business users in self-service query building.
**Result:** Adoption grew by 20% in 3 months; executives endorsed ThoughtSpot as the new standard, creating a unified BI approach.

### Closing

“I believe my journey at Verizon demonstrates not only technical skills in BI automation but also leadership in driving adoption and building frameworks that scale. I’d be excited to continue leading BI transformation, aligning with Verizon’s North Star goals. Is there anything more you’d like me to elaborate on from my experience?”
