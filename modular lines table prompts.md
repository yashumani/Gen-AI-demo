**PROMPT 1**

You are a Verizon Data Analyst.
Analyze the Lines Table provided below to extract the Top 10 metrics that exhibited the most significant movement, based on all available benchmark comparisons and week-over-week trends.
Lines Source Data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4j07mZWPVpq_K3dbAP77W3mejfMBlMNSKe_f10gJcA/edit
What to Analyze:
Current Week vs Forecast
Current Week vs Prior Year
Current Week vs Commit View (CV)
Month-to-Date (MTD) vs Forecast
MTD vs CV
MTD vs Prior Year
Weekly Trend (movement from previous weeks)
What to Consider:
Focus on the absolute size of the variance across all benchmarks.
Prioritize metrics that appear to have consistent trend movement or sudden spikes/reversals.
Avoid redundancy — if multiple rows represent the same driver (e.g., disaggregated price plans), summarize them under the most representative metric.
Disconnect metrics are inherently negative. Fewer disconnects is favorable; more is unfavorable.
Rank the Takeaways from Most to least impacting.
Output Format (Bullet Style):

For Example:-
[Metric Name] — Missed Forecast by 87K and CV by 75K; WoW reversal observed from last 3-week decline.
[Metric Name] — MTD variance against PY is +45K; double-digit mix growth in recent trend.
[Metric Name] — Strong surge this week, exceeding all benchmarks; needs deeper attribution next.
Do not include:
Root cause
Channel impact
Business implications

Title: Channel Attribution Analysis (Based on Top 10 Takeaways)

You are a Verizon data analyst. This document already includes the Lines Table data, summary-level analysis, and the Top 10 Takeaways. Your task now is to analyze those Top 10 metrics and determine which sales channels were responsible for the performance changes.

Use the following references for attribution insights:

Lines Table & Channel-Level Tables:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvRtixQ0sCV2_XUK_tpYbq1P8O-BatEM5-cjNKd5zEA/edit?tab=t.0

Source Data Sheet (Channel Views Tab):

Business Knowledge – Channel Strategy Notes:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UHvpzD3DDegkqiY4reM6hPgH4mfrLR5Z/edit

What to do:

For each metric in the Top 10 Takeaways:

Attribute the movement to the appropriate channel(s): Retail, Indirect, Digital, FWA.

Identify which channel(s) performed above or below forecast or trend.

Clarify whether the performance was consistent across all channels or driven by a few.

Pull in any relevant data from the business knowledge tracker for deeper context.

What to consider:

Compare Week-over-Week and MTD changes by channel.

Include variance math if available (e.g., "Retail channel exceeded forecast by 18.4K").

Highlight trends that differ between channels (e.g., “FWA declined, while Retail improved”).

Output Format (Repeat for each relevant Top 10 metric):

[Metric Name] — Channel Attribution Summary

• Primary channel contributor: [Retail / Indirect / Digital / FWA]
• Movement vs Forecast: [Favorable/Unfavorable] by [X]
• Channel disparities: [Example — Digital underperformed, while Retail drove gains]
• Supporting channel-level insight: [Quote trend or delta]
• Interpretation: [Summarize why the movement occurred, e.g., promo traction, digital lag]

Do not restate Top 10 summaries. Instead, enhance the analysis with channel-level context using the references above.
