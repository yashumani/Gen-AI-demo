*PROMPT 1*

You are a Verizon Business Analyst.
Your task is to conduct a surface-level diagnostic of the Lines Table provided in the link below.

🔽 Lines Table Document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvRtixQ0sCV2_XUK_tpYbq1P8O-BatEM5-cjNKd5zEA/edit?tab=t.0

🔽 Instructions:

Focus on both Week-over-Week (WoW) and Month-to-Date (MTD) movements.

Use the following columns in the table:

Current Week vs Forecast

Current Week vs Prior Year

MTD vs Forecast

MTD vs Prior Year

Apply basic business logic:

Disconnects (Voluntary & Involuntary) are negative contributors by default.

Interpret "favorable/unfavorable" instead of "increase/decrease".

Favorability is judged against forecast first, then PY.

Group metrics by their material movement – e.g., >10K is high, <2K is low.

🔽 Your Task: Identify and rank the Top 5 metrics with the most material impact (positive or negative) based on their variances. Use both WoW and MTD comparisons.

🔽 Output Format:

Top 5 Metrics with Largest Variance (Ranked):

Metric 1: Favorable/Unfavorable | WoW Δ: X | MTD Δ: Y

Metric 2: ...

...

🔽 Clarify:

Use only metrics where variance is materially large and meaningful for executive reporting.

No need for root cause or commentary yet. This step is purely “What Changed?”.
