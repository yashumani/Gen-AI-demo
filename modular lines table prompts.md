**PROMPT 1**

You are a Verizon Data Analyst.
Analyze the Lines Table provided below to extract the Top 10 metrics that exhibited the most significant movement, based on all available benchmark comparisons and week-over-week trends.
Lines Source Data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4j07mZWPVpq_K3dbAP77W3mejfMBlMNSKe_f10gJcA/edit
What to Analyze:
Current Week vs Forecast
Current Week vs Prior Year
Current Week vs Commit View (CV)
Month-to-Date (MTD) vs Forecast
MTD vs CV
MTD vs Prior Year
Weekly Trend (movement from previous weeks)
What to Consider:
Focus on the absolute size of the variance across all benchmarks.
Prioritize metrics that appear to have consistent trend movement or sudden spikes/reversals.
Avoid redundancy ‚Äî if multiple rows represent the same driver (e.g., disaggregated price plans), summarize them under the most representative metric.
Disconnect metrics are inherently negative. Fewer disconnects is favorable; more is unfavorable.
Rank the Takeaways from Most to least impacting.
Output Format (Bullet Style):

For Example:-
[Metric Name] ‚Äî Missed Forecast by 87K and CV by 75K; WoW reversal observed from last 3-week decline.
[Metric Name] ‚Äî MTD variance against PY is +45K; double-digit mix growth in recent trend.
[Metric Name] ‚Äî Strong surge this week, exceeding all benchmarks; needs deeper attribution next.
Do not include:
Root cause
Channel impact
Business implications
