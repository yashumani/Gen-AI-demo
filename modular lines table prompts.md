**PROMPT 1**

Title: Surface-Level Benchmark Analysis (Initial Discovery)
You are a Verizon Data Analyst. Analyze the Lines Table data (Weekly and MTD) using the Google Sheet provided below:
Lines Source Data:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4j07mZWPVpq_K3dbAP77W3mejfMBlMNSKe_f10gJcA/edit

üéØ Objective:
Identify Top 10 metrics exhibiting the most significant movement by comparing against all relevant benchmarks:

Current Week vs Forecast

Current Week vs Prior Year (PY)

Current Week vs Commit View (CV)

Month-to-Date (MTD) vs Forecast

MTD vs CV

MTD vs PY

Week-over-Week (WoW) trend change (3-week patterns if applicable)

üß† What to Consider:
Prioritize material movement (positive or negative).

Highlight strongest variance deltas across any benchmark.

Avoid redundancy ‚Äì group similar metrics (e.g., plan-level splits under one header).

Treat Disconnect metrics as inherently negative ‚Äì fewer is better, more is worse.

Look for sustained trends, reversals, or unexpected surges.

Ensure WoW changes are given space to stand alone if compelling.

üìù Output Format (Bullet Style):
[Metric Name] ‚Äî Missed Forecast by 87K and CV by 75K; WoW reversal observed from last 3-week decline.

[Metric Name] ‚Äî MTD variance against PY is +45K; double-digit mix growth in recent trend.

[Metric Name] ‚Äî Strong surge this week, exceeding all benchmarks; needs deeper attribution next.

üìä Use the Following Data Source for Attribution:
Lines by Channel Table (Embedded in Lines Doc)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvRtixQ0sCV2_XUK_tpYbq1P8O-BatEM5-cjNKd5zEA/edit

üìå Objective:
Identify whether the movement of each Top 10 metric was:

Driven by a specific channel (e.g., Retail, Digital, FWA, Indirect), OR

Consistent across channels (broad systemic trend)

üß† What to Consider:
Use channel-specific breakdowns from the Lines by Channel table to isolate patterns.

Attribute performance to the most material channel variance (positive or negative).

Distinguish between:

Channel-exclusive movements (e.g., "Retail drove +65% of GA variance")

Broad movements across multiple channels (systemic)

Explain if a known channel campaign (from business docs or promos) aligns with the observed change.

üìù Output Format (Repeat for Each of the Top 10 Metrics):
[Metric Name] ‚Äì Channel Attribution Summary
Primary Driver Channel: [Retail / Digital / FWA / Indirect]
Impact Magnitude: Contributed [X] of total variance (e.g., 65K of 102K MTD change)
Observed Channel Pattern:

[Channel Name] saw [X]% shift compared to forecast

[Brief narrative if other channels remained flat or opposed the trend]

Explanation:
This suggests that the overall change in [Metric] was primarily [channel-driven / systemic], influenced by [optional context: business push, promo strategy, seasonal shift].
