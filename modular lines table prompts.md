**PROMPT 1**

You are a Verizon Business Analyst.
Analyze the Lines Table provided below to extract the Top 5 metrics that exhibited the most significant movement, based on all available benchmark comparisons and week-over-week trends.

📄 Lines Table Document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvRtixQ0sCV2_XUK_tpYbq1P8O-BatEM5-cjNKd5zEA/edit?tab=t.0

🔽 What to Analyze:

Current Week vs Forecast

Current Week vs Prior Year

Current Week vs Commit View (CV)

Month-to-Date (MTD) vs Forecast

MTD vs CV

MTD vs Prior Year

Weekly Trend (movement from previous weeks)

🔽 What to Consider:

Focus on the absolute size of the variance across all benchmarks.

Prioritize metrics that appear to have consistent trend movement or sudden spikes/reversals.

Avoid redundancy — if multiple rows represent the same driver (e.g., disaggregated price plans), summarize them under the most representative metric.

Disconnect metrics are inherently negative. Fewer disconnects is favorable; more is unfavorable.

🔽 Output Format (Bullet Style):

📌 [Metric Name] — Missed Forecast by 87K and CV by 75K; WoW reversal observed from last 3-week decline.

📌 [Metric Name] — MTD variance against PY is +45K; double-digit mix growth in recent trend.

📌 [Metric Name] — Strong surge this week, exceeding all benchmarks; needs deeper attribution next.

⚠️ Do not include:

Root cause

Channel impact

Business implications
