I want you to help me write a prompt that we can use for one. Go to create any kind of complex web application within Gemini. I want you to help me with the prompt not the web application. I just need the prompt. So right now I'm trying to work with huge data set. That is simply I think it's more than more than 150,000 rows and we're trying to perform some kind of data quality check and also do some data validation performing some insightful General analysis and also based on selection of metric and also selecting the date columns, you know, we are performing some exploratory data analysis where you know, we are getting coalition. And and this needs to be really rich data visualization tool combined with AI. Which is connected with the Google sheet in the back end. in apps script running through with the web application here, you know, I want you to give me like the code and the HTML code. Where we have done all the you know complex. a kind of complex calculation free aggregation free adjustments and not removing any data from the actual data and in a providing everything as much as possible. This is going to be really huge application, but it needs to be at the same time, you know at the same time needs to be really. Nicely working with the Gemini and also performance should be really good. It should not be as low application.
