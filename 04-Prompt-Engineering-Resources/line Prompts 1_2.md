You are tasked with generating a comprehensive, contextual, and insight-driven commentary for the **Lines** data table. This task follows a structured analytical journey â€” starting with the summary-level Lines data and uncovering **root causes** using embedded business documentation.

**Note:** The input document now includes the Lines data table and reference materials (e.g., Promotions, Price Plans, Business Knowledge, News Events, Channel Data Tables). This format is designed to support richer interdependencies and correlation logic.

### Analytical Framework
Apply a **Chain-of-Thoughts** and **Tree-of-Thoughts** reasoning strategy:
- Use a sequential problem-solving approach to articulate what changed, why it changed, and how different variables contributed.
- Branch into **possible causes** using embedded references (promotions, news, pricing, business knowledge, channel-level drivers).
- Prioritize logical, data-backed pathways and consolidate into the most defensible narrative.

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Start with Summary Data:**
   - Identify largest WoW and MTD changes from the Lines Table.

2. **Prioritize Top 5 Takeaways:**
   - Focus only on **Top 5 observations** with the highest material impact (positive or negative).

3. **Metric-Specific Root Cause Analysis (Only for Top 5 Metrics):**
   - Perform deep dives using:
     - Business Logic (Data Dictionary)
     - Promotions
     - Price Plan Tracker
     - Channel Tables (within the document)
     - News Events
     - Business Knowledge
   - Apply analytical breakdown: clarify which sub-drivers caused the change, how each element contributed, and why it matters.

4. **Channel-Level Attribution Logic:**
   - Refer to embedded **Channel Data Tables** to identify:
     - Which channel(s) drove or suppressed each metric.
     - Whether a trend was channel-specific or universal.
   - Attribute key variances to appropriate channels with logic (e.g., FWA, Retail, Digital, Indirect).

5. **Establish Interdependencies & Correlations:**
   - Describe how shifts in one metric (e.g., Gross Adds) influenced others (e.g., Disconnects, Net Adds).
   - Correlate across reference sections to validate observations.

### Commentary Requirements

**Length:**
- No word count limit. Be comprehensive, insight-rich, and fully substantiated.

**Tone:**
- Professional, analytical, and suitable for executive reporting.

**Vocabulary:**
- Use: "favorable/unfavorable," "better/worse," "gained/missed."
- Always clarify benchmarks: Forecast, Prior Year, Commit View (CV).

---

### Output Structure

**1. Top 5 Takeaways:**
- Bulletized list.
- Emphasize most significant WoW and MTD movements.

**2. Metric-Specific Deep Dive (Only for Metrics in Top 5):**
- Break down major drivers.
- Include variance math (e.g., missed forecast by 9.5K).
- Explain impact using at least two reference sources.

**3. Interdependency Section:**
- Show relationships between Top 5 metrics.
- Reference data dictionary and channel tables as support.

**4. Correlation Section:**
- Provide five bullet points across:
  - Promotions
  - Price Plans
  - News Events
  - Business Knowledge
  - Channel Table
- Grouped by source to show multi-dimensional insights.

---

**Exclude:**
- Business Implications section.
- Analysis of metrics outside the Top 5.

**Reminder:**
- Your final output should walk the reader step-by-step from surface-level changes to root causes using a chain-of-thought method enhanced by tree-of-thought logic.
