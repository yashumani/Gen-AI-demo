✅ If there are 10 tables, analyze all 10 (continue listing insights until all tables are processed).
✅ Use structured formatting (headers, bullet points, bold highlights) for clarity.
✅ Do not summarize excessively—provide detailed explanations and data references.
✅ Ensure all business implications and recommendations are fully developed.

This fully detailed document should be complete and directly usable by stakeholders without requiring additional edits or additions.
