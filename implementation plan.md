# 🚀 **Gemini Use Case Implementation Roadmap (Phased Approach)**

### 📌 **Use Case Recap:**
Generate brief, contextually accurate commentary based on structured data extracted from **Google Sheets** and linked **Google Docs**, which have multiple sections and tables.  

---

## ✅ **Phase 1: Prompt Engineering (Current Focus)** 🎯

**Objective:**  
Create reliable and effective prompts that consistently yield high-quality brief commentary from Gemini based on structured data input.

**Key Tasks:**
- Define the **scope and format** of your desired output clearly (e.g., length constraints, tone, style).
- Experiment with various **prompt strategies** (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Role-based, Structured templates).
- Identify optimal prompt template(s) by testing with representative structured data manually.

### 🛠️ **Phase 1 Action Items:**

| Task No. | Action                                      | Deliverables/Output                             |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **1.1**  | Identify & document your target commentary style | Clearly defined criteria (length, tone, content structure) |
| **1.2**  | Prepare representative structured sample data | Example JSON structures extracted from Sheets & Docs |
| **1.3**  | Experiment with Zero-shot and Few-shot prompting | Documented performance/results for each approach |
| **1.4**  | Design Prompt Templates (Iterative refinement) | Finalized prompt template(s) validated through iterative manual tests |
| **1.5**  | Evaluate commentary quality & consistency   | Document examples and refine based on quality metrics (accuracy, style, completeness) |

**Expected Output (Phase 1):**
- **Validated prompt templates** that reliably generate concise, accurate, and high-quality commentary.
- A brief documentation clearly demonstrating success in prompt reliability (examples of successful Gemini outputs).

---

## 🛑 **Phase Gate:** **Evaluate Success Before Proceeding**  
- Assess prompt consistency, reliability, and quality.
- Confirm satisfaction of defined output requirements (clarity, brevity, relevance).

### 🎯 **Phase 2: Structured Data Extraction & Automation**

**Objective:**  
Automate and standardize structured data retrieval from Google Sheets and Google Docs to feed into Gemini prompts developed in Phase 1.

### 🛠️ **Phase 2 Action Items:**

| Task No. | Action                                      | Deliverables/Output                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **2.1**  | Set up automated data extraction (Google Sheets API) | Automated Python script extracting structured data |
| **2.2**  | Implement data extraction from Google Docs | Python/Apps Script automation for structured extraction |
| **2.3**  | Standardize extracted data (JSON/DataFrames) | Automated data standardization scripts       |
| **2.4**  | Integration tests of extracted data with Phase 1 prompts | Demonstration of accurate integration between data and prompts |

**Expected Output (Phase 2):**
- Robust, automated data retrieval and standardization processes that seamlessly feed into Gemini prompts.

---

## 🛑 **Phase Gate:** **Evaluate Data Extraction and Integration**
- Validate data extraction completeness, accuracy, and compatibility with prompts.

### 🎯 **Phase 3: Gemini API Integration & Commentary Automation**

**Objective:**  
Integrate Gemini API to fully automate commentary generation based on automated structured data inputs.

### 🛠️ **Phase 3 Action Items:**

| Task No. | Action                                      | Deliverables/Output                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **3.1**  | Set up Gemini REST API integration          | Authenticated API calls via Python scripts   |
| **3.2**  | Automate full pipeline (Data → Prompt → Gemini API) | Automated Python pipeline generating commentary |
| **3.3**  | Error Handling & Logging                    | Implement robust error management and logging |
| **3.4**  | Initial end-to-end testing & validation     | End-to-end automated pipeline demo           |

**Expected Output (Phase 3):**
- A fully automated, reliable Gemini-driven commentary generation pipeline from raw data input to finalized commentary output.

---

## 🛑 **Phase Gate:** **Final Evaluation & Approval**
- Verify reliability, accuracy, scalability, and consistency of fully automated commentary generation.

---

### 🎯 **Phase 4: Automated Output Delivery & Scheduling (Optional Enhancement)**

**Objective:**  
Automatically write generated commentary into destination outputs (Google Docs/Sheets) and schedule regular automated execution.

### 🛠️ **Phase 4 Action Items:**

| Task No. | Action                                      | Deliverables/Output                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **4.1**  | Output Automation (Google Sheets/Docs API)  | Script to automate delivery of commentary into final documents |
| **4.2**  | Set up Automated Scheduling                 | Implement scheduling using Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler, or Airflow |
| **4.3**  | Pipeline monitoring & alerting              | Automated monitoring and alerts on execution status |

**Expected Output (Phase 4):**
- Fully automated, regularly scheduled Gemini commentary generation and integration into production reporting.

## 🚩 **Your Current Focus (Prompt Engineering - Phase 1)**

At your current stage (Phase 1), specifically concentrate on:

- **Testing** various prompt strategies extensively (Few-shot and Structured templates are most recommended).
- **Iterative refinement** based on quality assessment.
- Clear, documented definition of successful prompt strategies for reliable output.

### ⚡ **Example Prompt Template for Initial Testing (Phase 1)**

**Template (Few-shot):**
```markdown
You are a business analyst generating brief commentary for Verizon’s business reports.

Example Input:
Section: Revenue Performance  
Period: February 2025  
Metrics: Revenue $2M (+4%), Margin 25%  
Drivers: Smartphones, Accessories  
Challenges: High churn rate  

Example Commentary:  
“Revenue increased 4% to $2M with a 25% margin, driven by Smartphones and Accessories. However, churn remains a notable concern.”

---

Now summarize this:

Input:  
Section: {{Section}}  
Period: {{Period}}  
Metrics: {{Metrics}}  
Drivers: {{Drivers}}  
Challenges: {{Challenges}}  

Brief Commentary:
```

This template structure enables rapid experimentation and consistency in outputs.

---

## ✅ **Conclusion & Immediate Next Steps:**

- **Start immediately with prompt experimentation and testing**.
- Document all experiments clearly.
- Move on to subsequent phases **only after** confirming robust, reliable prompt performance.

Using this phased approach clearly separates concerns, ensures incremental success, and helps effectively manage complexity in your Gemini-driven commentary generation initiative.
