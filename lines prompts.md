Leverage the data provided in the Lines table from this Google Doc link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2mQTrQNaIpQhvfEU0cbN2u4pK0Kgi4G-NZ4sb7tHJk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.myyew2fi9cgy and the corresponding business logic definitions provided in this Data Dictionary: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9HFsWp1xJm4s8Ibiui2LcJA2RpN3aLhN9wFCD4anmo/edit?tab=t.0


### Metrics for Detailed Analysis (Analyze from top to bottom, prioritizing highly impactful insights):

- **Phone Gross Adds**
  - Breakdown by Price Plans:
    - Unlimited Welcome
    - Unlimited Plus
    - Unlimited Ultimate
    - Other Premium
    - Other Unlimited/Metered
  - Premium Unlimited Mix%
  - Components:
    - New Phone Lines
    - Add a Line Phone

- **Phone Upgrades**

- **Phone Disconnects** *(Ensure explicit clarification: Disconnects are inherently negative; comparisons must use \"favorable/unfavorable\" or \"better/worse\" clearly.)*
  - Voluntary Disconnects
  - Involuntary Disconnects

- **Phone Net Adds** *(Explicitly calculated as Phone Gross Adds minus Phone Disconnects)*

### Commentary Requirements:

**Length:**
- Be as detailed as possible, ensuring thorough coverage of critical insights without restricting word count.

**Tone:**
- Professional, analytical, and insightful.
- Explicit clarity in defining comparisons and implications.

**Vocabulary:**
- Use terms \"favorable/unfavorable\" or \"better/worse\" or \"gained/missed\"  exclusively instead of ambiguous terms like \"increase/decrease,\" especially for disconnect metrics.
- Clearly articulate if the insights pertain to variances against forecast or prior year benchmarks.

**Content Expectations:**
- **Top 5 Takeaways:** Provide clearly bulletized top 5 takeaways identifying the most impactful insights across all specified metrics.
- **Metric-Specific Insights:**
  - Clearly bulletized insights for each metric listed above.
  - Explicitly illustrate interdependencies between metrics (e.g., how Price Plan performance impacts Phone Gross Adds, how variations in Gross Adds affect Phone Disconnects, and consequently Net Adds).
  - Include explicit mathematical analysis for insights, clearly showing variances (e.g., \"Phone disconnects missed their forecast by (96.5K), primarily due to the (85.1K) miss in voluntary disconnects\").
  - Explicitly reference benchmarks (forecast vs. prior year).
  - Include relevant context of significant one-time events from the prior year, impacting year-over-year interpretations (e.g., ATT outage from 2/20/24).
 
**Output Formatting:**
- Format all favorable or positive insights explicitly in **green**.
- Format all unfavorable or negative insights explicitly in **orange**.

Exclude any commentary on Business Implications from this analysis.
