### Meeting Objective:
Discuss the current status, challenges, and automation plan for the Desktop Procedure (DTP) involving data extraction, transition to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and SAP integration.

### Discussion Points:

1. **Data Source and Transition to GCP:**
   - Discussed transitioning legacy data sources (Tririga, IBM Tririga) to GCP.
   - Highlighted existing challenges, especially related to the SAP data extraction process.

2. **SAP Integration:**
   - SAP data currently extracted manually; potential solutions include automation via bots or direct integration.
   - Timeline uncertainty for direct SAP-GCP integration, needing further clarity from the CSG team.

3. **Automation via Bots and Alteryx:**
   - Explained the bot process, replicating manual tasks and scheduled execution.
   - Alteryx currently manually loaded with Excel and SAP data files for processing.
   - Interim solution proposed: manual files storage on shared G-drive/network accessible by Alteryx.

4. **Google Sheets Utilization:**
   - Confirmed Google Sheets as the output/reporting tool due to ease and flexibility.

5. **Challenges and Interim Approach:**
   - Immediate manual handling of file downloads considered manageable.
   - Long-term goal to fully automate all processes, starting with Q2.

### Decisions Made:
- Immediate interim solution: Manual file download, placement in shared drive, processed via Alteryx, output to Google Sheets.
- SAP Bot automation process initiation and documentation.
- Offshore support confirmed to assist with file processing for upcoming deadlines (March 26).
