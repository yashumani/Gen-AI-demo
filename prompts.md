- **Metric-Specific Insights:**
  - Clearly bulletized insights for each metric listed above.
  - Explicitly illustrate interdependencies between metrics (e.g., how Price Plan performance impacts Phone Gross Adds, how variations in Gross Adds affect Phone Disconnects, and consequently Net Adds).
  - Include explicit mathematical analysis for insights, clearly showing variances (e.g., \"Phone disconnects missed their forecast by (96.5K), primarily due to the (85.1K) miss in voluntary disconnects\").
  - Explicitly reference benchmarks (forecast vs. prior year).
