  - Voluntary Disconnects
  - Involuntary Disconnects

- **Phone Net Adds** *(Explicitly calculated as Phone Gross Adds minus Phone Disconnects)*

### Commentary Requirements:

**Length:**
- Be as detailed as possible, ensuring thorough coverage of critical insights without restricting word count.

**Tone:**
- Professional, analytical, and insightful.
- Explicit clarity in defining comparisons and implications.

**Vocabulary:**
- Use terms \"favorable/unfavorable\" or \"better/worse\" exclusively instead of ambiguous terms like \"increase/decrease,\" especially for disconnect metrics.
- Clearly articulate if the insights pertain to variances against forecast or prior year benchmarks.

**Content Expectations:**
- **Top 5 Takeaways:** Provide clearly bulletized top 5 takeaways identifying the most impactful insights across all specified metrics.
- **Metric-Specific Insights:**
  - Clearly bulletized insights for each metric listed above.
  - Explicitly illustrate interdependencies between metrics (e.g., how Price Plan performance impacts Phone Gross Adds, how variations in Gross Adds affect Phone Disconnects, and consequently Net Adds).
  - Explicitly reference benchmarks (forecast vs. prior year).
  - Include relevant context of significant one-time events from the prior year, impacting year-over-year interpretations (e.g., ATT outage from 2/20/24).

Exclude any commentary on Business Implications from this analysis.
- Explicitly articulate relationships between metrics (e.g., how performance in specific Price Plans affects Phone Gross Adds; how variances in Phone Gross Adds correlate with changes in Phone Disconnects, impacting Phone Net Adds).
- Clearly specify benchmarks being referenced (forecast vs. prior year).
- Include references to any significant one-time events from the prior year that could influence year-over-year interpretations (e.g., ATT outage from 2/20/24).
