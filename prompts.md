**Prompt for Lines/Accounts Table Analysis:**

Using the provided Lines/Accounts table data:

1. **Top Takeaways:**
   - Clearly summarize the top 3-5 key insights, focusing explicitly on Phone Gross Adds, Phone Disconnects, and Phone Net Adds.
   - Ensure each takeaway clearly states if the variance discussed is against the forecast (primary comparison) or prior year (secondary comparison).

2. **Key Changes and Contextual Commentary:**
   - Provide detailed commentary connecting changes in key metrics to underlying reasons, explicitly highlighting relationships between metrics. For instance, correlate changes in New Accounts with their direct impact on Gross Adds, or Lost Accounts with Disconnects.
   - Clarify explicitly whether increases or decreases refer to absolute metric changes or variances from forecast.

3. **Year-over-Year (YoY) Analysis:**
   - Identify and comment on any notable YoY variances, explicitly referencing significant one-time events from the previous year that may affect interpretation (e.g., outages or unusual consumer demand).

4. **Business Implications:**
   - Offer insightful, actionable commentary on the business implications of the highlighted variances, clearly indicating what strategic considerations or adjustments might be necessary.

**Requirements:**
- Length: Concise (approx. 150-300 words)
- Tone: Clear, Insightful, Action-oriented
- Content Expectations: Direct, context-aware, and explicitly relational between metrics.

Ensure the output matches the commentary style, depth, and clarity as defined in the provided expected output example.
