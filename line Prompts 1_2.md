### Prompt for Lines Table Commentary Generation

You are tasked with generating a clear, insightful, and contextual commentary for the **Lines** data table.

Use the information from the following resources:
- Lines Table: [Lines Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2mQTrQNaIpQhvfEU0cbN2u4pK0Kgi4G-NZ4sb7tHJk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.myyew2fi9cgy)  
- Data Dictionary: [Business Logic Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9HFsWp1xJm4s8Ibiui2LcJA2RpN3aLhN9wFCD4anmo/edit?tab=t.0)  
- Promotions Tracker: [Insert Link]  
- Business Context for Lines: [Insert Link]  

### Data Table Structure
- Column 1: Row Headers (metrics)  
- Columns 2 to 6: Prior Week Trend  
- Column 7: Current Week  
- Column 8: Mix % for Current Week  
- Columns 9 and 10: Current Week vs Forecast, vs Prior Year  
- Column 11: Month-to-Date (MTD)  
- Column 12: MTD Mix %  
- Columns 13 to 16: MTD vs Forecast, vs Commit View (CV), vs Prior Year, vs Prior Year %  

### Metrics for Detailed Analysis  
(Analyze from top to bottom. Prioritize and highlight only the most significant variances.)

1. Phone Gross Adds  
   - Highlight only the largest contributing or underperforming Price Plans:  
     - Unlimited Welcome  
     - Unlimited Plus  
     - Unlimited Ultimate  
     - Other Premium  
     - Other Unlimited/Metered  
   - Premium Unlimited Mix %

     - Add a Line Phone  

2. Phone Upgrades  

3. Phone Disconnects  
   - Voluntary Disconnects  
   - Involuntary Disconnects  
   - Clarify that disconnects are inherently negative. Use appropriate terminology to describe directionality (e.g., “favorable/unfavorable”, “better/worse”).  

4. Phone Net Adds  
   - Calculated as: Phone Gross Adds minus Phone Disconnects  

### Commentary Requirements

**Length**  
- Be as detailed and comprehensive as possible. There is no word limit.

**Tone**  
- Maintain a professional, analytical, and business-aligned tone.  
- Language should resemble that of a human-written executive brief, avoiding redundancy and generic phrasing.

**Vocabulary**  
- Use only the following terminology to describe change and comparison:  
  - “Favorable” / “Unfavorable”  
  - “Better” / “Worse”  
  - “Gained” / “Missed”  
- Do not use ambiguous terms such as “increase” or “decrease.”  
- Always specify the benchmark being referenced: Forecast, Prior Year, or Commit View.

### Content Expectations

**Top 5 Takeaways**  
- Clearly bulletized and prioritized.  
- Focus only on the most significant variances across all metrics.  
- Avoid unnecessary detail on subcategories unless it drives a major change.

**Metric-Specific Insights**  
- Provide bulletized insights under each metric heading.  
- Emphasize key changes using explicit calculations where applicable.  
  - Example: “Phone disconnects missed forecast by (96.5K), primarily due to the (85.1K) miss in voluntary disconnects.”  
- Identify the most significant contributors to any gain or miss.  
- Support insights with forecast and prior year comparisons.  
- Mention any notable one-time events affecting comparisons (e.g., AT&T outage on 2/20/24).

**Metric Interdependencies Section**  
- Provide a dedicated section that clearly outlines interrelated impacts between metrics.  
  - For example, “The drop in phone upgrades may have contributed to elevated disconnects due to aging devices.”  
  - Use business knowledge, promotions, and contextual information to explain why these shifts may be occurring.  

**Exclude**  
- Do not include a Business Implications section.
