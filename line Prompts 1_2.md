Commentary Requirements:
Length:
Be as detailed as possible with no word count restriction.
Make sure that the entire document is created and that there are no incomplete sections.

Tone:
Professional, analytical, and insightful.
Use clear language to define variances and their implications.
Vocabulary:
Use terms like "favorable/unfavorable," "better/worse," and "gained/missed" instead of "increase/decrease."
Always specify if the insight is vs forecast, prior year, or commit view (CV).
Content Expectations:
Top 5 Takeaways:
Bulletized top 5 insights identifying the most impactful weekly and MTD observations from the Lines table.
Metric-Specific Insights - Focus on explaining the metrics that have the most significant impact during the given week.:
Detailed Commentary on insights under each metric.
Report only the largest positive or negative drivers under each price plan or subcomponent to reduce redundancy.
Clearly show interdependencies between metrics (e.g., how Gross Adds influenced Disconnects, or how Upgrades may suppress Disconnects).
Include explicit calculations (e.g., "Phone disconnects missed their forecast by (96.5K), primarily due to the (85.1K) miss in voluntary disconnects.")
Include context for YoY comparisons (e.g., one-time events like the ATT outage from 2/20/24).
Add a distinct Interdependency Section summarizing logical connections between metrics. Take the reference from the Data Dictionary and business understanding documents to explain the interdependency with appropriate logic.
Create a distinct "Correlation" section that outlines the 5 most logical connections between the metrics and the supporting documentation (Promos, Price Plans, and News Articles). Please ensure that the top 5 bullet points are created for each document type and combined into a single section.

Exclude commentary on business implications from this analysis.
