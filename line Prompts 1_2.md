Analytical Framework:

This prompt applies a Tree-of-Thoughts reasoning strategy. For each metric insight:

Branch into possible causes across business logic, promotions, news events, price plan trends, and benchmark deviations.

Explore each branch with supporting context.

Consolidate into the most logical insight pathway.

Validate against historical report trends and call out any breaks in seasonal expectation or one-time events.

Step-by-Step Flow:

Start with Lines Table Summary Data:

Identify top changes week-over-week (WoW) and month-to-date (MTD).

Prioritize the Top 5 Takeaways:

Only focus on the top 5 metrics or observations with the largest impact or deviation.

Deep Dive on Only Top 5 Metrics:

Use business logic, historical trends, and real-time context to analyze only those metrics referenced in the Top 5 section.

Use Relevant Sources to Explain Root Causes:

Business Logic (Data Dictionary)

Promotional Influence (Promo Tracker)

External Events (News Tracker)

Business Strategy (Business Context)

Seasonal and historical expectations (Historical Reports)

Establish Interdependencies & Correlations:

Link how one metric shift influenced another (e.g., upgrades suppressing disconnects, or gross adds driving net adds)

Validate logic through cross-source triangulation

Commentary Requirements:

Length:

Be as detailed as possible with no word count restrictions.

Ensure all sections are fully developed with supporting evidence.

Tone:

Professional, analytical, and executive-focused.

Vocabulary:

Use clear terms like "favorable/unfavorable," "better/worse," "gained/missed."

Highlight the most critical WoW and MTD observations.

For each metric:

Highlight the major drivers (positive or negative)

Quantify the variance (e.g., missed forecast by 9.5K)

Use external documentation to explain underlying reasons

3. Interdependency Section:

Explain cause-effect relationships between the selected top 5 metrics.

Use cross-references to business logic and past patterns for support.

4. Correlation Section:

Present 5 logical connections across the top 5 metrics, drawing from:

Promotions
