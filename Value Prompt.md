You are tasked with analyzing the Value Segment data tables to generate highly impactful insights clearly and contextually. Use the data provided in the Value Segment tables from this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2mQTrQNaIpQhvfEU0cbN2u4pK0Kgi4G-NZ4sb7tHJk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.myyew2fi9c, and reference the corresponding business logic definitions from this Data Dictionary: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9HFsWp1xJm4s8Ibiui2LcJA2RpN3aLhN9wFCD4anmo/edit?tab=t.0


### Metrics for Detailed Analysis (Analyze from top to bottom, prioritizing highly impactful insights):

**1. Core Value Brands (Total Value)**
- Breakdown by Brands (explicitly excluding Safelink):
  - Brand-specific Gross Adds
  - Brand-specific Disconnects
  - Brand-specific Net Adds (Gross Adds minus Disconnects)

**2. Gross Adds**
- Identify top-performing brands driving favorable results

**3. Disconnects** *(Ensure explicit clarification: Disconnects are inherently negative; comparisons must use \"favorable/unfavorable\" or \"better/worse\" clearly.)*
- Highlight brands contributing significantly to disconnect trends

**4. Net Adds** *(Explicitly calculated as Gross Adds minus Disconnects)*
- Clearly identify which brands impacted Net Adds the most significantly

### Commentary Requirements:

**Length:**
- Be as detailed as possible, ensuring thorough coverage of critical insights without restricting word count.

**Tone:**
- Professional, analytical, and insightful.
- Explicit clarity in defining comparisons and implications.

**Vocabulary:**
- Use terms \"favorable/unfavorable\" or \"better/worse\" or \"gained/missed\" exclusively instead of ambiguous terms like \"increase/decrease,\" especially for disconnect metrics.
- Clearly articulate if the insights pertain to variances against forecast or prior year benchmarks.

**Content Expectations:**
- **Top 5 Takeaways:** Provide clearly bulletized top 5 takeaways separately for each table (Core Value Brands, Gross Adds, Disconnects, Net Adds), identifying the most impactful insights.
- **Metric-Specific Insights:**
  - Clearly bulletized insights for each metric listed above.
  - Explicitly illustrate interdependencies between metrics (e.g., how brand-specific Gross Adds performance impacts overall Net Adds, and how Disconnect trends by brand influence total Net Adds).
  - Include explicit mathematical analysis for insights, clearly showing variances (e.g., \"Disconnects missed their forecast by (20.0K), driven primarily by Brand Xâ€™s unfavorable variance of (15.0K)\").
  - Explicitly reference benchmarks (forecast vs. prior year).
  - Include relevant context of significant one-time events from the prior year, impacting year-over-year interpretations (e.g., promotional events, market disruptions).

**Output Formatting:**
- Format all favorable or positive insights explicitly in **green**.
- Format all unfavorable or negative insights explicitly in **orange**.

Exclude any commentary on Business Implications from this analysis.
